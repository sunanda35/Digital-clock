It just a simple digital clock programming using c programming language.
Here you can see double loop for some time gap. It can be slighly wrong timing, because here have to calculate accurate time laps for every second. This time laps can be slightly wrong. You can change it yourself. 
And also it is ainfinite loop with some time laps. So you have to cut CMD for close it. OtherWise it will run continuously.
So, best of luck.......
